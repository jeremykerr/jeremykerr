GnuPG
==============

    What is it?
    -----------

    GPG, or the Gnu Privacy Guard, is a tool that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data.

    How can it be used?
    -------------------

    Bob is a simple man, with simple ideas. Once, he tripped over a rock.

    Alice is Bob's friend. She is helpful, and was able to get Bob to the hospital when he tripped.

    Eve is a bit of a gossip. She always knows what's going on, for better or worse. She suspected Bob and Alice might be more than friends. She thought they might be good friends! Eve was determined to find out.

    Mallory is a spiteful and bitter woman. Her singular goal in life is to trip up others. Once, she put a rock on Bob's front doorstep.

    Bob, Alice, Eve, and Mallory, are all next door neighbors. One day, Bob decided he was going to hang out with Alice, so he gave her a phone call. When she picked up, he asked her if she wanted to go for a walk with him. Beaming, she agreed, and quickly ran to his front doorstep, only to find Eve waiting. Mallory spied on them from behind a bush.

    "My goodness!" Alice exclaimed. "What on earth are you doing here, Eve?"

    "I wanted to watch you and Bob go for a walk" replied Eve, breathing heavily.

    When Bob opened the door to find not one, but two people on his front doorstep, he fainted from pure shock, and was out for several hours. Alice eventually nursed him back to health, and after years of painful physical therapy, he made a full recovery from his surprise.

    "Golly Alice, I'd sure like to hang out with you, but I can't bear the thought of being surprised like that again!" Bob told her.

    "Don't fret Bob, I have a plan! We'll use Gnu Privacy Guard, or GPG, to make a secret plan! I suspect Eve bugged your phone last time, and that's how she knew when to show up on your front porch." Alice replied.

    "Well, whatever it is, sign me up! But how in tarnation can you expect us to make a plan using GPG? Won't Eve just read it and know what's going on? She has those neww NSA brand spy goggles that let her see everything! They can even see your soul! Well, except Mallory's." Bob continued to mumble about goggles for several moments until Alice cut him off.

    "Bob, remember that time you tripped and hit your head? Don't say, but remember the thing you tripped over? We'll use that word as our shared secret," Alice said, winking as she said secret, "and you can tell me when and where you'd like to meet using symmetric encryption."

    How do we want to use it?
    -------------------------

    In this instance, I wanted to use GPG to make an IoT cluster living in a network I have no control over be self-healing. My devices are similar to Bob and Alice in the story. They need to be able to communicate securely, even though there are untrusted actors
