About
=====

    I'm a software developer based out of Berkeley, CA. My interests tend to change somewhat organically, but my current skillset is based around Ansible, AWS, Linux, Python, and PostgreSQL. I do keep my eyes on up-and-coming technology though, which you can find under `Interests </pages/interests.html>`_ if you're curious.

    Books are fun! I like books! If you're looking for good books to read, I'd recommend a few.

    - Lexicon, by Max Barry
        + Sci-fi novel imagining a world where spoken words have unusual sway over people
    - Simple Steps to Data Encryption, by Peter Loshin
        + Whimsical story about Bob, Eve, Mallory, and Alice, their goals and communication
    - Infrastructure as Code, by Kief Morris
        + Best practices in the age of cloud infrastructure and repeatable progress
    - How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie
        + Terrific book advising how to get along with nearly anyone, to build lasting relationships
    - Calvin and Hobbes, by Bill Watterson
        + Not really a novel or textbook, but the cartoons and philosophy I grew up reading

    I've spent the last several years keeping a few hundred IoT devices online, as well as helping maintain and expand the backend infrastructure. The team I work with sells Energy Savings as a Service - a unique business model where we go into large facilities, install better equipment to save clients money on their energy bill, and then charge for part of the savings to cover our equipment and labor costs.

    Best regards,
