    <h1>Jeremy Kerr</h1>
    <p>I'm a software developer currently based out of Denver, CO. I am the most familiar with Python, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, and AWS, though quickly adopting new technologies is a hobby of mine. The best technical book I've read in the last year is 'Infrastructure as Code' by Kief Morris. In it, he highlights the strengths of an infrastructure where configuration files drive functionality. The real benefits of infrastructure as code don't become apparent until infrastructure fails or software releases break, and need to be immediately brought back to the prior version.</p>
    <p>We live in the age of Cloud and IoT. Instead of managing tens of servers, we manage thousands. Jobs need to be broken down, run asynchronously, decentralized, and fault tolerant. The minimum viable product that includes user privacy and security is more difficult to achieve than it ever has been. The networking challenges associated with managing devices and DNS records, as well as interacting with legacy systems in a robust way are incredibly difficult, but tremendously fun.</p>
    <p>This site exists as a place for me to create notes for myself and my ongoing projects, but my hope is that these will also help the unfortunate souls who find themselves here in attempts to solve their own problems.</p>
    <p>Good luck,</p>
    <p><em>Jeremy</em></p>
