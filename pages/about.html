    <h1>About</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I'm a software developer based out of Berkeley, CA. My interests tend to change somewhat organically, but my current skillset is based around Ansible, AWS, Linux, Python, and PostgreSQL. I do keep my eyes on up-and-coming technology though, which you can find under <a href="/pages/interests.html">Interests</a> if you're curious.</p>
        <p>Books are fun! I like books! If you're looking for good books to read, I'd recommend a few.</p>
