    <blockquote>
        <p>These blog posts won't really teach you very much about software, but you might learn a little about the software development cycle from reading about my misguided efforts to be an industry leader in taking two steps forward and five flips back. I've said it before, and I'll say it again - I'm a good software developer, but far from graceful, and taking some time to reflect on my painstaking efforts to overcome seemingly insignificant hurdles is an fun way to diffuse frustration through humor.</p>
